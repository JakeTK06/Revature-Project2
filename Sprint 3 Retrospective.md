# Sprint Retrospective  
##### (Kevin Cabral, David Ho, Jacob Kurkowski, Harsh Patel) 
## What went well 
Our group was able to coordinate very well together which kept us working at a good pace and allowed us to accomplish everything we needed to. We were able to coordinate effectively through the use of daily stand ups where we would evaluate our progress and what we needed to get done for the day to keep ahead of schedule. We were able to use paired programming and git to coordinate our efforts efficiently. For our DevOps pipeline we found it to be straight forward to implement which led to our decision to build out the pipeline further to run automatically whenever the repo updated and send reports to an email. Another part of the project we found went well was our defect fixing for planets and moons. The two shared a lot of defects so when we fixed it for one, we would already have a good understanding of the defect in the other so we could fix it quickly. We also found that a lot of the code for updating planets and moons was already there, so it was quick to implement after making a few updates and adding the functionality to the front end.  

## What can be improved for the next Sprint? 
While the daily meetings kept us on track, we could have better budgeted our time to deal with the issues we encountered in the html files and specifically working with the JavaScript functions. There was a lot that we had to learn to write the JavaScript correctly and we could have had more people on the task to help get the fixes in sooner. Another thing that could have been improved is how long it takes to run the tests. We could have performed some simple performance testing to figure out where bottle necks were and tried to relieve them a bit. Another part that took some time was converting SQLite to PostgreSQL because we were not familiar with the syntax for PostgreSQL, we were unsure how much of the existing database set up we could use vs what needed to be slightly changed.  

## What work still needs to be done for next Sprint
If there were a next sprint, we would like to optimize our JavaScript functions because our system end to end tests take a long time to run specifically for the delete functionality. We would also like to conduct performance and load testing on the planetarium to see if there are other areas of the application that can be run more efficiently. We would also like to build out automated system testing for the update feature because we only had time to build automated testing in the service and repository layers and manual system testing. Last we started to integrate our system testing into our DevOps pipeline but ran out of time to finish.
